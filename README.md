## Description


My motivation was to learn the basics of coding and to prepare myself for the upcoming bootcamp in web development. 
I built this project step by step, following the guidelines on the course page. 
It is a prework study guide which helps organizing the information I've learned about the basic elements of web design so far, including HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript, and it is displayed on a simple website that I created durint the prework.
I've learned so many things during the prework, I've set up a Github account and added SSH keys, learned to use the terminal, the Git flow, learned about the basics of html, css and javascript.
